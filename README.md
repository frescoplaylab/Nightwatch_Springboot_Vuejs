Showdown 6 problem for the global devops hackathon.

Nightwatch.js is used to write functional test cases.
We have done the same for our Vue JS base arena,
but for some reason we where unable to run the tests.
Setup Nightwatch.js by writing the correct config file(s) & installing the correct/appropriate drivers.

And our dev ran out of caffeine before he could complete the load_home_page.js.
It's upto you to write an excellent functional test to check the loading of the home page.
